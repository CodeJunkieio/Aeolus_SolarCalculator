## üéâ Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to Team Aeolus Solar Calculator project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask ‚Äî or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions just [shoot the maintainer an email](mailto:andikan@sure.ng) or if you are a member of the [HNGi6 organisation](https://github.com/hngi), head over to the HNGi6 Slack channel and DM **@andy** or **@makos24**.

## üõ† Create a branch

This repository has two evergreen branches: `master` and `develop`
 (avoid directly committing changes to these two branches).

| Branch | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| `master` | Master is always deployable and only accepts merges from `develop`. |
| `develop` | Accepts merges from feature and issue branches. |
| Feature/Issues | Always branch off `HEAD` of `develop`. Prefix feature branches with your name (e.g. `user-feature_name`). Prefix issue branches with the issue number (e.g. `123-issue_name`). |
| Hotfixes | In rare cases, hotfix branches must be created to quickly update the project. Always branch off `master` and make sure those changes make it back into develop. |

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Team Aeolus follows the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.
